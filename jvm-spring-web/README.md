## Features

### Welcome Banner

You can test the implementation of the welcome banner endpoint which will return the banner based on the country.

You will get the following messages based on what country you provide (or the *default*).

| Country   | Text                                    |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| _default_ | Welcome to the Java SDK!                |
| france    | Bienvenue au SDK Java !                 |
| spain     | Â¡Bienvenidos y bienvenidas al SDK Java! |

You can make an example request with cURL:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/welcome-banner?country=:country
```

### Meal Order

You can test the implementation of a more complex, Gson serializable and deserializable class instance using the meal order endpoint.

The following request will return the standard meal based on the explicit check for the gluten-free restriction configured in GrowthBook.

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/meal\?dietary_restrictions\=nut_allergy\&dietary_restrictions\=vegan
```

The following request should return the gluten-free meal:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/meal\?dietary_restrictions\=gluten_free\&dietary_restrictions\=vegan
```
